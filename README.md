### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2018

+ Projec Fun facts of inauguration in the re-elected presidents
+ This project is conducted by Zhongxing Xue(zx2221)

+ Project summary: 

The inauguration speeches are always one of the most important events of the presidents. Many experts try to analyze which kinds of person would they be through the inauguration speeches. In particular, those presidents who get re-elected would be the focus of analysis, because they had 8 years -- a very long time -- to administer the whole country.

In this project, we will focus on the inauguration of the presidents who got re-elected. We apply statistic models, as well as text mining method to analyze those speeches: Is there any different between one's 2-terms speeches? Is there any tendency toward speeches from first term to second term? We will give answers in the doc folder.
